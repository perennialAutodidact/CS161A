# Assignment:       Midterm (CS161A)
# Date:             November 5, 2022
# Description:      This program will determine the winner of a rock collecting 
                    competition by determining which of three players collected 
                    the most rocks. The program will prompt for each playerâ€™s 
                    name and the number of rocks they collected. It will then 
                    output the first, second, and third place player and the 
                    number of rocks each collected, accounting for ties where 
                    players have equal numbers of rocks. Finally, the program 
                    will output the average number of rocks collected before 
                    exiting.
# Input:            string player1, string player2, string player3
                    int rockCount1, int rockCount2, int rockCount3
# Output:           prompts for names of each player and the amount of rocks
                    they collected. The winning placement of each player
                    and the average number of rocks per player.
